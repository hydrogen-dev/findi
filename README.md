What am I looking at?

This is the source code for joinfindi.org. FINDI is a consortium created at Hydrogen, that intends to promote the use of public blockchains in the financial applications (where it makes sense) to encourage decentralization and transparency. This is an open collaborative effort, and we'd love to have anyone join. Developers, event planners, hedgefund managers, anyone!
